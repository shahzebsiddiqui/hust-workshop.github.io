We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC
community. 

## Format

Submissions should be a minimum length of 8 pages (IEEE conference
format) and no longer than 10 pages 
(see https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 
The page limit includes figures, tables, and your appendices, 
but does not include references, for which there is no page limit. 
Papers should be submitted in PDF format. We kindly refer authors to 
the necessary templates [2].

All submissions should be made electronically through the SC18 Submissions
website [3].  Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should
remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to
earlier work. When discussing past work, they need to refer to
themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another
researcher's work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of
interest with the PC chair or PC members.

Proceedings will be published in the IEEE Xplore digital
library through collaboration with IEEE TCHPC.
